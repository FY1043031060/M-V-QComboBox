//! Computer went to hibernation mode and the board lost power. Solution:
//! prevent the computer from going to hibernation mode in the control panel.
#define nxErrPowerSuspended                  (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x007)

//! A write queue overflowed. Solution: wait until queue space becomes available
//! and retry.
#define nxErrOutputQueueOverflow             (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x008)

//! The board's firmware did not answer a command. Solution: Stop your

//! driver in the Device Manager. If the problem persists, contact National
//! Instruments.
#define nxErrFirmwareNoResponse              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x009)

//! the operation, or change the operation in a way that it can get completed in
//! less time (e.g. read less data).
#define nxErrEventTimeout                    (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x00A)

//! A read queue overflowed. Solution: reduce your data rate or call Read more
//! frequently.
#define nxErrInputQueueOverflow              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x00B)

//! The Read buffer is too small to hold a single frame. Solution: provide a
//! buffer large enough.
#define nxErrInputQueueReadSize              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x00C)

//! You tried to open the same frame twice. This is not permitted. Solution:
//! open each frame only once.
#define nxErrDuplicateFrameObject            (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x00D)

//! You tried to open the same stream object twice. This is not permitted.
//! Solution: open each stream object only once.
#define nxErrDuplicateStreamObject           (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x00E)

//! Self test is not possible since the board is in use by an application.
//! Solution: stop all NI-XNET applications before executing a self test.
#define nxErrSelfTestNotPossible             (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x00F)

//! Allocation of memory failed. You do not have sufficient memory in the
//! LabVIEW target. Solution: add more RAM or try to use fewer resources in your
//! applications (arrays, XNET sessions, etc).
#define nxErrMemoryFull                      (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x010)

//! The maximum number of sessions was exceeded. Solution: use fewer sessions.
#define nxErrMaxSessions                     (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x011)

//! The maximum number of frames has been exceeded. Solution: Use fewer frames
//! in your sessions.
#define nxErrMaxFrames                       (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x012)

//! The maximum number of devices has been detected. Solution: use fewer
//! devices.
#define nxErrMaxDevices                      (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x013)

//! A driver support file is missing. Solution: try reinstalling the driver. If
//! the error persists, contact National Instruments.
#define nxErrMissingFile                     (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x014)

//! This indicates that a NULL pointer or an empty string was passed to a
//! function. The user should verify that the parameters passed in make sense
//! for the given function.

//! National Instruments.
#define nxErrSelfTestError6                  (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x017)

//! You cannot start an NI-XNET application while a self test is in progress.
//! Solution: Complete the self test before starting any NI-XNET applications.
#define nxErrSelfTestInProgress              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x018)

//! An invalid reference has been passed to a NI-XNET session function.
//! Solution: Only pass reference retrieved from Create Session, or from an IO
//! name of a session in LabVIEW project.
#define nxErrInvalidSessionHandle            (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x020)

//! An invalid reference has been passed to a NI-XNET system function. Solution:
//! Only pass a valid system reference.
#define nxErrInvalidSystemHandle             (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x021)

//! A device reference was expected for a NI-XNET session function. Solution:
//! Only pass a device reference.
#define nxErrDeviceHandleExpected            (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x022)

//! An interface reference was expected for a NI-XNET session function.
//! Solution: Only pass an interface reference.
#define nxErrIntfHandleExpected              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x023)

//! You have configured a property that conflicts with the current mode of the
//! session. For example, you have created a CAN output session with a frame
//! configured with a Timing Type = Cyclic and a Transmit Time of 0.
#define nxErrPropertyModeConflicting         (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x024)

//! XNET Create Timing Source VI is not supported on Windows. This VI is
//! supported on LabVIEW Real-Time targets only.
#define nxErrTimingSourceNotSupported        (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x025)

//! You tried to create more than one LabVIEW timing source for a single
//! interface. Only one timing source per interface is supported. The timing
//! source remains until the top-level VI is idle (no longer running). Solution:
//! Call the XNET Create Timing Source VI only once per interface. You can use
//! the timing source with multiple timed structures (e.g. timed loops).
#define nxErrMultipleTimingSource            (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x026)

//! You invoked two or more VIs simultaneously for the same session, and those
//! VIs do not support overlap. For example, you attempted to invoke two Read
//! VIs at the same time for the same session. Solution: Wire the error cluster
//! from one VI to another, to enforce sequential execution for the session.
#define nxErrOverlappingIO                   (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x027)

//! You are trying to start an interface that is missing bus power for the
//! transceiver. Some physical layers on NI-XNET hardware are internally
//! powered, but others require external power for the port to operate. This
//! error occurs when starting an interface on hardware that requires external
//! power when no power is detected. Solution: Supply proper voltage to your
//! transceiver. Refer to the NI-XNET Hardware Overview in the NI-XNET Hardware
//! and Software Manual for more information.
#define nxErrMissingBusPower                 (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x028)

//! The connection with a CompactDAQ chassis was lost, and the host software and
//! modules are out of sync. There is no direct recovery for this problem until
//! the chassis is reset. Solutions: Call DAQmx Reset Device as the first VI or
//! function in your application, prior to creating XNET sessions. Alternately,
//! you could reset the CompactDAQ chassis in Measurement and Automation
//! Explorer (MAX).
#define nxErrCdaqConnectionLost              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x029)

//! The transceiver value set is invalid (for this port, e.g. LS on a HS port)
//! or you are trying to perform an operation that requires a different
//! transceiver (e.g., trying to change the state of a disconnected
//! transceiver). Solution: set a valid value.
#define nxErrInvalidTransceiver              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x071)

//! The baud rate value set is invalid. Solution: set a valid value.
#define nxErrInvalidBaudRate                 (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x072)

//! No baud rate value has been set. Solution: set a valid value.
#define nxErrBaudRateNotConfigured           (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x073)

//! The bit timing values set are invalid. Solution: set valid values.
#define nxErrInvalidBitTimings               (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x074)

//! The baud rate set does not match the transceiver's allowed range. Solution:
//! change either the baud rate or the transceiver.
#define nxErrBaudRateXcvrMismatch            (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x075)

//! The configured terminal is not known for this interface. Solution: Make sure
//! that that you pass in a valid value to Connect Terminals or Disconnect
//! Terminals.
#define nxErrUnknownTimingSource             (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x076)

//! The configured terminal is inappropriate for the hardware. For example,
//! setting a source to FrontPanel0 on XNET hardware that doesn't have
//! front-panel trigger inputs, or selecting PXI_Clk10 for a non-PXI device.
//! Solution: Pick an appropriate terminal for the hardware.
#define nxErrUnknownSynchronizationSource    (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x077)

//! The source that you connected to the Master Timebase destination is missing.
//! When the start trigger is received, the interface verifies that a signal is
//! present on the configured source. This check has determined that this signal
//! is missing. Solution: Verify that your cables are configured correctly and
//! that your timebase source is generating an appropriate waveform.
#define nxErrMissingTimebaseSource              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x078)

//! The source that you connected to the Master Timebase destination is not
//! generating an appropriate signal. When the start trigger is received, the
//! interface verifies that a signal of a known frequency is present on the
//! configured source. This check has determined that this source is generating
//! a signal, but that the signal is not one of the supported frequencies for
//! this hardware. Solution: Verify that your source is generating a signal at a
//! supported frequency.
#define nxErrUnknownTimebaseFrequency           (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x079)

//! You are trying to disconnect a synchronization terminal that is not
//! currently connected. Solution: Only disconnect synchronization terminals
//! that have previously been connected.
#define nxErrUnconnectedSynchronizationSource   (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x07A)

//! You are trying to connect a synchronization terminal that is already in use.
//! For example, you are trying to connect a trigger line to the Master Timebase
//! when a different trigger line is already connected to the Master Timebase.
//! Solution: Only connect to synchronization terminals that are not currently
//! in use.
#define nxErrConnectedSynchronizationTerminal   (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x07B)

//! You are trying to connect an XNET terminal as a source terminal, but the
//! desired XNET terminal is not valid as a source terminal. Solution: Only
//! connect valid source terminals to the source terminal in XNET Connect
//! Terminals.
#define nxErrInvalidSynchronizationSource       (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x07C)

//! You are trying to connect an XNET terminal as a destination terminal, but
//! the desired XNET terminal is not valid as a destination terminal. Solution:
//! Only connect valid destination terminals to the destination terminal in XNET
//! Connect Terminals.
#define nxErrInvalidSynchronizationDestination  (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x07D)

//! You are trying to connect two XNET terminals that are incompatible.
//! Solution: Only connect a source and destination terminals that are
//! compatible with each other.
#define nxErrInvalidSynchronizationCombination  (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x07E)

//! The source that you connected to the Master Timebase destination has
//! disappeared. When the start trigger is received, the interface verifies that
//! a signal is present on the configured source. This check has determined that
//! this signal was present, but while the interface was running, the signal
//! disappeared, so all timebase configuration has reverted to using the onboard
//! (unsynchronized) oscillator. Solution: Verify that your cables are
//! configured correctly and that your timebase source is generating an
//! appropriate waveform the entire time your application is running.
#define nxErrTimebaseDisappeared                (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x07F)

//! You called Read (State : FlexRay : Cycle Macrotick), and the FlexRay
//! Macrotick is not connected as the master timebase of the interface.
//! Solution: Call Connect Terminals to connect source of FlexRay Macrotick to
//! destination of Master Timebase.
#define nxErrMacrotickDisconnected           (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x080)

//! The database specified could not be opened. Solution: Check that the alias
//! and/or the file exist and that it is a valid database.
#define nxErrCannotOpenDatabaseFile          (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x081)

//! The cluster was not found in the database. Solution: Make sure you only
//! initialize a cluster in a session that is defined in the database.
#define nxErrClusterNotFound                 (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x082)

//! The frame was not found in the database. Solution: Make sure you only
//! initialize frames in a session that are defined in the database.
#define nxErrFrameNotFound                   (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x083)

//! The signal was not found in the database. Solution: Make sure you only
//! initialize signals in a session that are defined in the database.
#define nxErrSignalNotFound                  (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x084)

//! A necessary property for a cluster was not found in the database. Solution:
//! Make sure you only initialize a cluster in a session that is completely
//! defined in the database.
#define nxErrUnconfiguredCluster             (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x085)

//! A necessary property for a frame was not found in the database. Solution:
//! Make sure you only initialize frames in a session that are completely
//! defined in the database.
#define nxErrUnconfiguredFrame               (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x086)

//! A necessary property for a signal was not found in the database. Solution:
//! Make sure you only initialize signals in a session that are completely
//! defined in the database.
#define nxErrUnconfiguredSignal              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x087)

//! Multiple clusters have been specified in one session, either directly
//! (Stream I/O), or through the signals or frames specified. Solution: Make
//! sure that in one session, you open only one cluster, including frames or
//! signals that belong to the same cluster.
#define nxErrMultipleClusters                (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x088)

//! You specified a database of ':subordinate:' for a session mode other than
//! mode of Frame Input Stream. Solution: either open a Frame Input Stream
//! session, or use a real or in-memory database.
#define nxErrSubordinateNotAllowed           (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x089)

//! The interface name given does not specify a valid and existing interface.
//! Solution: Use a valid and existing interface. These can be obtained using
//! MAX, XNET system properties, or the LabVIEW XNET Interface IO name. If you
//! are using CompactRIO, refer to the topic "Getting Started with CompactRIO"
//! in the NI-XNET Hardware and Software Help.
#define nxErrInvalidInterface                (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x08A)

//! The operation is invalid for this interface (e.g. you tried to open a set of
//! FlexRay frames on a CAN interface, or tried to request a CAN property from a
//! FlexRay interface). Solution: run this operation on a suitable interface.
#define nxErrInvalidProtocol                 (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x08B)

//! You tried to set the AutoStart property to FALSE for an Input session. This
//! is not allowed. Solution: don't set the AutoStart property (TRUE is
//! default).
#define nxErrInputSessionMustAutoStart       (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x08C)

//! The property ID you specified is not valid (or not valid for the current
//! session mode or form factor).
#define nxErrInvalidPropertyId               (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x08D)

//! The contents of the property is bigger than the size specified. Use the
//! nxGetPropertySize function to determine the size of the buffer needed.
#define nxErrInvalidPropertySize             (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x08E)

//! The function you called is not defined for the session mode (e.g. you called
//! a frame I/O function on a signal I/O session).
#define nxErrIncorrectMode                   (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x08F)

//! The data that you passed to the XNET Write is too small to hold all the data
//! specified for the session. Solution: determine the number of elements
//! (frames or signals) that you configured for the session, and pass that
//! number of elements to XNET Write.
#define nxErrBufferTooSmall                  (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x090)

//! For Signal Output sessions, the multiplexer signals used in the session must
//! be specified explicitly in the signal list.
#define nxErrMustSpecifyMultiplexers         (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x091)

//! You used an XNET Session IO name, and that session was not found in your
//! LabVIEW project. Solution: Within LabVIEW project, right-click the target
//! (RT or My Computer), and select New > NI-XNET Session. Add the VI that uses
//! the session under the target. If you are using the session with a built
//! application (.EXE), ensure that you copy the built configuration file
//! nixnetSession.txt such that it resides in the same folder as the executable.
#define nxErrSessionNotFound                 (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x092)

//! You used the same XNET session name in multiple top-level VIs, which is not
//! supported. Solution: Use each session in only one top-level VI (application)
//! at a time.
#define nxErrMultipleUseOfSession            (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x093)

//! To execute this function properly, the session's list must contain only one
//! frame. Solution: break your session up into multiple, each of which contains
//! only one frame.
#define nxErrOnlyOneFrame                    (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x094)

//! You used the same alias for different database files which is not allowed.
//! Solution: Use each alias only for a single database file.
#define nxErrDuplicateAlias                  (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x095)

//! You try to deploy a database file while another deployment is in progress.
//! Solution: wait until the other deployment has finished and try again.
#define nxErrDeploymentInProgress            (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x096)

//! A signal or frame session has been opened, but it doesn’t contain signals or
//! frames. Solution: specify at least one signal or frame.
#define nxErrNoFramesOrSignals               (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x097)

//! An invalid value has been specified for the ‘mode’ parameter. Solution:
//! specify a valid value.
#define nxErrInvalidMode                     (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x098)

//! A session was created by references, but no database references have been
//! specified. Solution: specify at least one appropriate database reference
//! (i.e. signal or frame or cluster ref depending on the session mode).
#define nxErrNeedReference                   (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x099)

//! The interface has already been opened with different cluster settings than
//! the ones specified for this session. Solution: make sure that the cluster
//! settings agree for the interface, or use a different interface.
#define nxErrDifferentClusterOpen            (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x09A)

//! The cycle repetition of a frame in the database for the FlexRay protocol is
//! invalid. Solution: Make sure that the cycle repetition is a power of 2
//! between 1 and 64.
#define nxErrFlexRayInvalidCycleRep          (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x09B)

//! You called XNET Clear for the session, then tried to perform another
//! operation. Solution: Defer clear (session close) until you are done using
//! it. This error can also occur if you branch a wire after creating the
//! session. Solution: Do not branch a session to multiple flows in the diagram.
#define nxErrSessionCleared                  (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x09C)

//! You called Create Session VI with a list of items that does not match the
//! mode. This includes using: 1) signal items for a Frame I/O mode 2) frame
//! items for a Signal I/O mode 3) cluster item for a mode other than Frame
//! Input Stream or Frame Output Stream
#define nxErrWrongModeForCreateSelection     (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x09D)

//! You tried to create a new session while the interface is already running.
//! Solution: Create all sessions before starting any of them.
#define nxErrInterfaceRunning                (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x09E)

//! You wrote a frame whose payload length is larger than the maximum payload
//! allowed by the database (e.g. wrote 10 bytes for CAN frame, max 8 bytes).
//! Solution: Never write more payload bytes than the Payload Length Maximum
//! property of the session.
#define nxErrFrameWriteTooLarge              (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x09F)

//! You called a Read function with a nonzero timeout, and you used a negative
//! numberToRead. Negative value for numberToRead requests all available data
//! from the Read, which is ambiguous when used with a timeout. Solutions: 1)
//! Pass timeout of and numberToRead of -1, to request all available data. 2)
//! Pass timeout > 0, and numberToRead > 0, to wait for a specific number of
//! data elements.
#define nxErrTimeoutWithoutNumToRead         (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x0A0)

//! Timestamps are not (yet) supported for Write Signal XY. Solution: Do not
//! provide a timestamp array for Write Signal XY.
#define nxErrTimestampsNotSupported          (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x0A1)

// \REVIEW: Rename to WaitCondition
//! The condition parameter passed to Wait is not known. Solution: Pass a valid
//! parameter.
#define nxErrUnknownCondition                (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x0A2)

//! You attempted an I/O operation, but the session is not yet started (and the
//! AutoStart property is set to FALSE). Solution: call Start before you use
//! this IO operation.
#define nxErrSessionNotStarted               (NX_ERROR_BASE | 0x0A3)

//! The maximum number of Wait operations has been exceeded. Solution: If you
//! are waiting for multiple events on the interface, use fewer Wait operations
//! on this interface (even for multiple sessions). If you are waiting for
//! multiple events for a frame (e.g. transmit complete), use only one Wait at a
